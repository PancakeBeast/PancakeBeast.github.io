<h1>Hobbies of the mighty PancakeBeast</h1>
The PancakeBeast got a lot of hobbies (not really). Amongst those, we find that he likes to run and play video games. 
<br>
    There has been a few games at stake in his heart. In his early days, he cruised on gaming sites for random games.
    <br>
    He soon found love with the multiplayer game "Bomb it" and other bomberman games. 
    <br>
    This is something he found quite amusing. And as time went on, he'd change to other games.
    <br>
    There was a time when he fell for the game "Cocktail girl" Where you were a girl serving cocktails.
    <br>
    As he progressed in this game, he unlocked new drinks to sell to the customers. Fire of heart is an example.
    <p>
    His last sight at one of these gaming sites is found while he was playing "Galaxy Life" often called "GL".
    <br>
    This is a well-shaped game where you build your own base, and attack others. 
    <br>
    This stayed at PancakeBeast central station of gaming for quite a while, as it fell in taste.
    <p>
    A new era had started, and PancakeBeast began to play his first big game.
    <br>
    And this game was quite a good one, keeping him occupied for several years, and still to this day as well.
    <br>
    This was world of tanks, a huge MMO Tank game that caught him on his bed. 
    <br>
    This acted as glue to his thigh whilst the PC staying on his lap. He continued to play this.
   <p> 
    This strange game (not really) keeping his attention for centuries (not really).
    <br>
    PancakeBeast even got a friend on his team, made him play the game. This was a breakthrough.
    <br>
    He finally got a real gaming friend. But we may not distress, from the main subject.
    <br> 
    The almighty emperor gradually mastered this pure game.
    <br> 
    He became the king of the hill, with excellent marksmanskip, as well as being a tactical genious.
    <br> 
    This way, he is today amongst the top 1% of the players, honing his skillz against noobbz
    <p>
    But this is not all, PancakeBeast has played a lot of games, and right now there is a new game.
    <br> Although being quite weak at this game, the emperor is taking steps, learning the new physics.
